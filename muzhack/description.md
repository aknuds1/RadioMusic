## A virtual radio module for Eurorack

This is not a radio. It is a sample player that behaves like a radio.

A digital way to simulate the radio-powered compositions of John Cage and
Karlheinz Stockhausen as well as Don Buchla's voltage-controlled radio experiments.
It uses a [Teensy 3.1/3.2](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) to play files from an
SD card to simulate a voltage controlled AM/FM/Shortwave/Time Travel radio.
