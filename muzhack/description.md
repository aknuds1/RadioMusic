## A virtual radio module for Eurorack

This is not a radio. It is a sample player that behaves like a radio.

A digital way to simulate radio-powered compositions by John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen and
Don Buchla's voltage-controlled radio experiments. It uses a teensy3.1 to play files from a SD
card to simulate a voltage controlled AM/FM/Shortwave/Time Travel radio.
