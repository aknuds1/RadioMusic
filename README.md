This is not a radio. It is a sample player that behaves like a radio.  

A digital way to simulate the radio-powered compositions of John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen as well as Don Buchla's voltage-controlled radio experiments. It uses a [Teensy 3.1/3.2](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) to play files from an SD card to simulate a voltage controlled AM/FM/Shortwave/Time Travel radio. 

####Progress  

May 2016
- Merged Jouni's latest changes into the main branch
- New Beta versions in the Collateral/Hex Files folder: Crossfade and a new Bank Change interface
- If you're developing firmware yourself, make sure you read the 'Edited Teensy Files' section, because this has changed significantly

March 2016  
- Updated firmware Beta produced by Jouni Stenroos, fixing several long-term issues including file count limit, hot swapping and resets.
